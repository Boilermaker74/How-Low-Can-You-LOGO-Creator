## Description 

This application produces a simple logo which consists of a three-letter logo centered in a geometric shape. The user has the choice of four shapes, a circle, a triangle, a square or a star. The user also inputs the three letters that they would like to incorporate into the logo. Finally, the user chooses the colors for the letters and the shape. The user can enter the color choice as a color keyword or a hexadecimal number. Once the user completes their choices, the application saves the image as an SVG file.

## Testing 

The application employes unit testing using the jest npm package. Development of the application followed the test driven development (TDD) paradigm in which test are developed before the code is actually written. The errors that ensue are used to design the eventual code. The test can be run by typing “npm test” at the command line. If the code is faulty, an error message will detail the problem.![alt-text](assets/images/screenshot1.png)
